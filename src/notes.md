# Gamma Hadron Classification

Using the magic04 dataset we are going to train a model to be able to classify whether a particle is a gamma or hadron particle given the selected features.

## Notes
- since the data is labeled this is an example of supervised learning
- this is an example of a classification problem

### Features
AKA column headers

#### Qualitative Data
- qualitiative data is categorical meaning it has a finite number of categories or groups
- within qualitative data there is nominal data and ordinal data
- nominal data means there is no inherent order
- ordinal data means they have an inherent order

#### Quantitative Data
- quantitative data is numerical and could be discrete or continuous
- discrete meaning data that only takes certain values
- continuous meaning data that have an order

## Classification 
- classification means we are trying to predict discrete classes
- generally there is binary and multi-class classification
- binary ex: sentiment(pos/neg),
- multi-class ex: types of animals(dog/cat/boar/shark/etc.)

## Regression
- used to predict continuous values (a number on some sort of scale)
- ex: stock market, housing prices
